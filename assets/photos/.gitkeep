# This file ensures the photos directory is tracked by Git

# You can delete this file once you add your first photo

# To test the photo system immediately:

# 1. Add any .jpg or .png files to this folder

# 2. Update /\_data/photos.yml with matching filenames

# 3. Rebuild your Jekyll site

# The current sample entries in photos.yml reference:

# - sample-photo-1.jpg

# - sample-photo-2.jpg

# - sample-photo-3.jpg

# - sample-photo-4.jpg

# - sample-photo-5.jpg

# - sample-photo-6.jpg

# Replace these with your actual photo filenames!
